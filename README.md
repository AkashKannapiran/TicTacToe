# Tic Tac Toe Game

This Java program implements a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game. The game supports two modes: 1 vs 1 (two human players) and 1 vs computer. The computer player makes random moves.

## How to Play

 1. Run the program, and it will prompt you to choose a game mode:
   - Enter `1` for 1 vs 1 (two human players).
   - Enter `2` for 1 vs computer.

 2. For the 1 vs 1 mode:
   - Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column (1-3) for their move.

 3. For the 1 vs computer mode:
   - Player 1 (X) enters moves as in the 1 vs 1 mode.
   - The computer (O) makes random moves.

 4. The game ends when one player wins, or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

 5. After each game, you have the option to play again by entering 'y' or exit by entering 'n'.
